# idea: use the NIST data to determine structure of the molecule
# 1) convert NIST low res data to high res data
# 2) Convert the fragment information to a tensor with dimensions #H, #C, etc

# 3) Convert the smiles data to a what-is-connected-to-what tensor: dimensions C_no = C1, C2, C3 und H_no = H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10

I have multiple non uniform kernels, is there a py package based on LSTM which does the handling
ChatGPT

Handling non-uniform kernels with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks in Python can be accomplished using various libraries and frameworks. While there may not be a specific package that is exclusively designed for this exact task, you can build a custom solution using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Here's a high-level approach to handle non-uniform kernels using LSTM:

    Data Preparation: First, you need to prepare your data. This typically involves converting your input sequences into a format suitable for training an LSTM network.

    Model Definition: Define an LSTM-based model architecture that can handle non-uniform kernels. You can create custom layers and logic to handle varying kernel sizes and shapes. This may involve using techniques like sequence padding or masking to handle sequences of different lengths.

    Training: Train your model using your prepared data. You'll need a labeled dataset for supervised learning or a suitable objective function for unsupervised learning, depending on your task.

    Evaluation: Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics and validation datasets.

To implement this, you can use libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for defining and training the LSTM model. Here's a basic example using TensorFlow:

python

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Define an input layer for variable-length sequences
input_layer = Input(shape=(None, input_feature_dim))

# LSTM layer
lstm_layer = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(input_layer)

# Output layer (e.g., classification or regression)
output_layer = Dense(output_dim, activation='softmax')(lstm_layer)

# Create the model
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

You'll need to adapt this code to your specific use case and data. Depending on your requirements, you may need to add more complexity to your model architecture to handle non-uniform kernels effectively.

In summary, there's no pre-built Python package that specializes in handling non-uniform kernels with LSTM, but you can implement a custom solution using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The key is to preprocess your data and design an appropriate model architecture to handle the non-uniformity in kernel sizes.

    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# You can then use the trained model for prediction
